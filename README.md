# Voice Controlled Home Automation 
# Voice Controlled Home Automation System by AStromanish

Welcome to the Voice Controlled Home Automation System project by AStromanish! This project utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to enable voice commands for controlling various devices in your home.

## Overview

This project aims to provide an intuitive and convenient way to interact with your home appliances and devices using voice commands. By integrating IoT devices with NLP capabilities, users can control their home environment simply by speaking commands.

## Features

- Voice recognition and processing for controlling devices
- Integration with IoT devices for home automation
- Flexibility to control multiple devices simultaneously
- Easy setup and configuration

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller
- IoT devices compatible with the chosen platform (e.g., smart bulbs, smart plugs, etc.)
- Microphones for capturing voice commands
- Internet connection for accessing NLP services

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi or preferred microcontroller.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Configure your IoT devices to be compatible with the system.
4. Set up access to a NLP service for voice recognition and processing.
5. Run the main script to start the voice-controlled home automation system.

## Usage

1. Ensure all devices are properly connected and configured.
2. Activate the system by running the main script.
3. Issue voice commands to control your devices. For example:
   - "Turn on the lights in the living room."
   - "Set the thermostat to 72 degrees."
   - "Turn off all devices."
4. Enjoy the convenience of controlling your home with just your voice!

## Limitations

- Accuracy of voice recognition may vary depending on ambient noise and microphone quality.
- Compatibility with certain IoT devices may be limited based on manufacturer specifications.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve and enhance the project are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests through the GitHub repository.
